# Exploring how software systems behave beyond the textbook 🌱

Computer Science student at **The Ohio State University**  
Building systems, exploring ideas, and growing as a software engineer.

## 👋 About me

I’m a CS student interested in **how software systems are built, scaled, and used in the real world**.

Recently, I’ve been working as an undergraduate researcher in a Driving Simulation Lab, where I design and improve Python-based tooling for research workflows. Through this work, I’ve gained hands-on experience with data processing, testing, and performance trade-offs, but I don’t see myself as limited to any single niche.

I’m still exploring, learning, and expanding:  
from backend systems and tooling  
to performance, infrastructure, and developer-facing software.

## 🔍 What I’m exploring

- 🧱 Software engineering fundamentals (data structures, design, testing)
- ⚙️ Backend and systems-oriented development
- 📈 Performance, scalability, and real-world trade-offs
- 🛠 Tooling that helps people work more effectively
- 🧪 Research-driven and user-centered engineering

_(This list is intentionally open-ended.)_

## 🧩 Selected work

- **OSU Driving Simulation Lab – pydre**
  - Python tooling for processing large-scale driving simulation data
  - Contributed features, refactors, and test coverage improvements
  - Focus on correctness, maintainability, and practical performance

- **Parallelism Benchmark (pydre)**
  - Explored how threading and multiprocessing behave under different workloads
  - Built reproducible benchmarks and analysis pipelines
  - Learned that performance is about trade-offs, not just “more parallelism”
 
- **CSV vs Parquet Benchmark**
  - Investigated how data format choices impact real Python workflows
  - Compared readability, flexibility, and performance trade-offs
  - Used Polars to ground format decisions in measurement rather than assumptions

_(More projects live in individual repositories.)_

## 🌐 Beyond code

Outside of engineering, I care a lot about **communication and people**.

- 🎨 Adobe Student Ambassador — leading hands-on workshops
- 📹 Content creator with **13M+ views**, explaining ideas to broad audiences
- 🌍 Experience working across cultures and disciplines

I believe good software is built by people who can think clearly *and* communicate well.
